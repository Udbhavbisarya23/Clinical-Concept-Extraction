## Running the code

The preprocessed pkl files are available in this repository. To run each colab notebook:-
<br />
1. Upload all the pkl files to a folder of your choice to google drive 
2. Run the first cell of "Preprocessing and Preparing the Datasets" section and mount the drive
3. In the next cell, change the folder location to the drive location selected in step 1.
4. Once done, run all the cells.
